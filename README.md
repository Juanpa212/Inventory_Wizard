This is the inventory wizard application a capstone project made by Juan Pabon and Andres Rodriguez
this is an inventory managment application made for peoplee that are not too tech savvy and are starting 
to get into commerce. the goal here is to help small businesses organize adn visualize their stock. this app 
has features such as invoice managment, low stock notification and edit features for both inventories as well
as items.

prior to starting, once you have all required components installed, you can start the app, by typing "npx expo start" 
on the terminal and then choosing which ever emulation device is prefered, if you download the expo app, in your 
mobile app store, you can use your physical device to simulate the app, via reading the generated barcode. if you 
wish to run it on a virtual divice for windows it is necessary to download the virtual device emulator from android 
studio, if you have a mac you can also run it on xcode, if x code enjoyers even exist, but for most of us that us the 
VS code text editor, you'll need the emulator extension, and route the downloaded emulator of choice into the extensions 
settings. This is our first project so any and all constructive criticism is appreciated! happy coding!

carpe diem!
